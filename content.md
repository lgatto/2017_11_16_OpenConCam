## Yes, it's personal!

I don't know about you, but I care a lot about my work. I am a
scientist doing research in the area of computational biology,
especially spatial proteomics. At the end of my degree (that was in
biology), I wasn't able to imagine anything else I could do other than
research. I never intended to do the kind of research I am doing now,
but I wanted to understand the world around me. What has fascinated me
since the beginning in my work is the method of scientific
investigation, a method to observe, define hypothesis, test them and,
eventually understand any aspect of our world we want to learn about.

What are some of the features that make this scientific investiagtion
such a universally powerful paradigm? The science that I am passionate
about is characterised by:

- **Trust** - I need to trust to stand on your shoulders.
- **Reproducible** - it's not only your shoulders I will stand on.
- **Open** - I need to know what I am going to stand on. And I want
  everybody to be able to know.

I didn't realise this as a young PhD student, when initiating my
journey. Nobody actually ever taught me that these concepts are among
the very foundation that make science what it is, that we can stand on
the shoulders of the giants that preceded us and that, may be, others
will be able to stand on our shoulder, on day. This is the kind of
science that I am passionate about, that I feel I can do until the
very end.

## So what is this talk about?

It is about the science that **we** are passionate about, it's about
the science that we can trust.

But that is not always the science that is practised. 

This is a quote shared with us by one of the signatories of the
**#BulliedIntoBadScience** campaign.

> I have been constantly harassed by superiors to modify data in order

We all have constrains in our work, in our everyday live. We don't
live and work in an ivory tower. Times are hard. Things are certainly
harder for many than there are for me. We have to live with these
constrains, and we have to do our research with these in mind. 

But there are some compromises that we won't want to make. We want to
pursue our research following our values, following the principles
that prompted us and guided us along the way.
