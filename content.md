## Together on a journey

I am going to tell you about a long, still on-going a journey. I'll
talk about my journey, but it applies to many, I know. And when you
are on a long journey, you meet many people, take help you
along. Before telling more about this journey, I would like to thank
some that are close to my heart when it comes to open science and open
research. These are the people who helped organising this event, and
its predecessors; these are people that share the values I will be
talking about; and there's in particular the ever inspiring Corina
Logan, who is the person who initiated and who leads the
#BulliedIntoBadScience campaign.

## Yes, it's personal!

I don't know about you, but I care a lot about my work. I am a
scientist doing research in the area of computational biology,
especially spatial proteomics. At the end of my degree (that was in
biology), I wasn't able to imagine anything else I could do other than
research. I never intended to do the kind of research I am doing now,
but I wanted to understand the world around me. What has fascinated me
since the beginning in my work is the method of scientific
investigation, a method to observe, define hypothesis, test them and,
eventually understand any aspect of our world we want to learn about.

What are some of the features that make this scientific investigation
such a universally powerful paradigm? The science that I am passionate
about is characterised by:

- **Trust** - I need to trust to stand on your shoulders.
- **Reproducible** - it's not only your shoulders I will stand on.
- **Open** - I need to know what I am going to stand on. And I want
  everybody to be able to know.

I didn't realise this as a young PhD student, when initiating my
journey. Nobody actually ever taught me that these concepts are among
the very foundation that make science what it is, that we can stand on
the shoulders of the giants that preceded us and that, may be, others
will be able to stand on our shoulder, on day. This is the kind of
science that I am passionate about, that I feel I can do until the
very end.

## So what is this talk about?

It is about the science that **we** are passionate about, it's about
the science that we can trust.

But that is not always the science that is practised. 

This is a quote shared with us by one of the signatories of the
**#BulliedIntoBadScience** campaign.

> I have been constantly harassed by superiors to modify data in order
> to provide better agreement with known experimental values in order
> to make the paper look better for publishing at prestigious
> journals.

We all have constrains in our work, in our everyday live. We don't
live and work in an ivory tower. Times are hard. Things are certainly
harder for many than there are for me. We have to live with these
constrains, and we have to do our research with these in mind. 

But there are some compromises that we won't want to make. We want to
pursue our research following our values, following the principles
that prompted us and guided us along the way.

## The campaign

> The [Bullied Into Bad Science](http://BulliedIntoBadScience.org/)
> campaign is an initiative by early career researchers (ECRs) for
> early career researchers who aim for a fairer, more open and ethical
> research and publication environment.

## Some background

The **#BulliedIntoBadScience** campaign didn't come out of the blue,
but is the result of efforts of many people that didn't lead to
successful outcomes. Efforts that often lead to disappointment and
frustrations.

We have already written about the background behind the campaign, such
as for example in [link] and [link]. Here, I want to provide a short
summary to give you an idea of why this campaign exists.

## Success?

It is difficult to say whether the campaign has been successful so
far. Success is relative anyway But here are a couple of points that
we could consider indicators of success, or lack thereof.


- [Corina](http://corinalogan.com/) just won a Shuttleworth Foundation
  Flash Grant for **#BulliedIntoBadScience**! **WIN**

- Numbers: **135 ECRs have signed it** - **71 non-ECRs support it** -
  unsure what they really mean.

- Feedback - **WIN** (all good, no bad)

- In Cambridge - **FAIL**. (But that doesn't matter, as long as others
  benefit. It never was meant to be a Cambridge thing anyway) ...
  
- ... Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in Cambridge: "No way
  on Godâ€™s earth" - **FAIL**

## Continuing the fight

- Approach prominent academics directly, because we need to show that
  those in charge also care, so that ECRs don't feel intimidated to
  raise their voice. 

- Evidence to the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee
  inquiry on [Research
  Integrity](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/research-integrity-17-19/).
  
- Update our web page, add translations translations, regular blog
  posts, ....

- Bring the discussion about DORA to the Regent House (University of
  Cambridge)?

## Everyday struggle

- And my **day job**? Why do *ECR* need to fight for **better**,
  **open** and more **trustworthy** research?
  
- What's the impact on being an open activist on my **career**?
  **Good, IMHO**!
  
- So much work, so little time. There are too many fights to pick -
  **pick the battles that matter most to you**.

- There are multiple ways to fight any battle, and often several are
  needed in parallel: **official** procedure and **community** efforts.
