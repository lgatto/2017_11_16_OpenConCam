## Together on a journey

## Yes, it's personal!

## **Trust** - I need to trust to stand on your shoulders.

## **Reproducible** - it's not only your shoulders I will stand on.

## **Open** - I need to know what I am going to stand on. And I want **everybody** to be able to know.


## Yes, it's personal!

## So what is this talk about?

## It's about the science that we are passionate about.

## 

> I have been constantly harassed by superiors to modify data in order
  to provide better agreement with known experimental values in order
  to make the paper look better for publishing at prestigious
  journals.

##  The **Bullied Into Bad Science** campaign is an initiative by early career researchers (ECRs) for early career researchers who aim for a **fairer**, more **open** and **ethical** research and publication environment.

## Background

- Elsevier/JISC negotiations (mid 2016) - **FAIL**
- Discussions at the University of Cambridge (end 2016) - *mixed results*
- Informal discussions with pro VC (start 2017) - **FAIL**
- Going public with **#BulliedIntoBadScience** (June 2017)

## Success?


## Success?

- Corina just won a Shuttleworth Flash Grant for **#BulliedIntoBadScience**! **WIN**
- Numbers: **135 ECRs have signed it** - **71 non-ECRs support it** - *?*
- Feedback - **WIN** (all good, no bad)
- In Cambridge - **FAIL**. (But that doesn't matter, as long as others
  benefit. It never was meant to be a Cambridge thing anyway) ...
- ... Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in Cambridge: "No way
  on Godâ€™s earth" - **FAIL**

## Continuing the fight
- Approach prominent academics directly.
- Evidence to the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee
  inquiry on [Research
  Integrity](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/research-integrity-17-19/).
- Update our web page, translations, regular blog posts, ....
- Bring the discussion about DORA to the Regent House (University of Cambridge)?


## Everyday struggle

- And my **day job**? Why do *ECR* need to fight for **better**, **open**
  and more **trustworthy** research?
- What's the impact on being an open activist on my **career**?
  **Good, IMHO**!
  
## More struggle
  
- So much work, so little time. There are too many fights to pick - **pick the battles that matter most to you**.
- There are multiple ways to fight any battle, and often several are
  needed in parallel: **official** procedure and **community** efforts.

## No researcher is too junior to fix science!
