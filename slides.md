## Yes, it's personal!

## **Trust** - I need to trust you to stand on your shoulders.

## **Reproducibility** - it's not only your shoulders I will stand on.

## **Openness** - I need to know what I am going to stand on. And I want **everybody** to be able to know.


## Yes, it's personal!

## So what is this talk about?

## So what is this talk about? It's about the science that **we** are passionate about.

## **But** that is not always the science that is practised.

##  The **Bullied Into Bad Science** campaign is an initiative by early career researchers (ECRs) for early career researchers who aim for a **fairer**, more **open** and **ethical** research and publication environment.

## Because a **good** researcher and a **successful** researcher are not the same thing.

## All this isn't without some struggle...

## Everyday struggle

- And my **day job**? Why do *ECR* need to fight for **better**, **open**
  and more **trustworthy** research?

## Everyday struggle

- And my **day job**? Why do *ECR* need to fight for **better**, **open**
  and more **trustworthy** research?
- What's the impact of being an open activist on my academic
  **career**?  **Good, IMHO**!

## More struggle
  
- So much work, so little time. There are too many fights to pick -
  **pick the battles that matter most to you**.

## More struggle
  
- So much work, so little time. There are too many fights to pick - **pick the battles that matter most to you**.
- There are multiple ways to fight a battle, and often several are
  needed in parallel: **official** procedure and **community**
  efforts.

## It's not *only* personal.

## It's not *only* personal - standing on the shoulders of ECRs.

## No researcher is too junior to fix science!
